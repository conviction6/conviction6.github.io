I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School. My research interests include computer vision, large model inference, and cross-modal learning. I am dedicated to efficient large-scale model design and inference optimization, with a focus on deploying vision models in resource-constrained environments.
